## Coding Girls 👩🏾‍💻
This repository contains my solved activities from the first two weeks of Coding Girls, an immersive 4-week course taught by [Blue EdTech ](https://blueedtech.com.br/) that aims to teach from the beginning the syntax and base of the C# programming language.

The scope of the last two weeks consists of the development of an API that allows managing the students of an educational institution. The repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/lohanna54/educational-api)
